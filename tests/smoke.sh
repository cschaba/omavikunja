# reads, the settings schema the shell builds a panel from, the QML, and the
# shell scripts that install and release the plugin.
#
# None of it needs a running shell, a display or a network, and none of it
# writes anywhere but a throwaway directory — HOME is redirected there so a
# tool that decides to cache something cannot reach the real one.
#
# Ported from omaipsum's tests/smoke.sh. The dispatcher check comes from
# omapass, which twice shipped a `case` branch calling a deleted function: bash
# only complains when the branch is taken, so anything with a `case` in it gets
# walked here.
