# Cut a release: check everything, bump the version, move the changelog entry,
# commit, tag, push.
#
# A maintainer tool, run by hand from a local checkout after a fix has been
# merged to main. It is not part of installing or running omavikunja — no user
# ever executes it, and nothing in the plugin calls it. One release per fixed
# issue, as AGENTS.md has it, which is also why the release bookkeeping is one
# of the two things that happen on main directly instead of on a branch.
#
# The version lives in exactly one place, manifest.json. Omarchy reads it from
# there, so a second copy anywhere else could only drift; this script therefore
# rewrites that one field and nothing else.
#
# Two ordering rules run through the whole thing:
#
#   Everything that can fail is checked before a tag exists. A tag you have to
#   delete and re-push is worse than a release that refuses to start, because
#   the tag is the thing other people (and later, CI) have already reacted to.
#   So the tests, the parsers and the remote are all consulted while the tree
#   is still untouched, and the script exits non-zero with one line saying why.
#
#   The commit is pushed before the tag. A remote that has a tag pointing at a
#   commit it does not have is broken in a way nobody can fix by pulling; a
#   remote that has the commit but not yet the tag is merely a release that has
#   not finished, and the next line of this script finishes it.
#
# The `git fetch` below only *counts* how far behind the remote this checkout
# is. Nothing fetched is ever checked out, merged or run — the fetch touches
# refs and the object store, never the working tree, and FETCH_HEAD is read
# only by `git rev-list --count`. Releasing from a checkout that is behind is
# how a fix gets tagged out of a tree that does not contain it.

  Refuses unless the tree is clean, you are on main and in step with the
  remote, the tag is free, manifest.json is valid, CHANGELOG.md has a
  non-empty [Unreleased] section, every shell script and QML file parses,
  and the tests in tests/ pass.

  Then: bumps the version in manifest.json, moves the [Unreleased] entries
  under a new dated heading in CHANGELOG.md, commits, tags vX.Y.Z, pushes
  the commit and then the tag to the GitHub origin, and mirrors both to
  Gitea if that remote is configured.

  --dry-run prints every one of those steps, in order, and writes nothing.

  Environment: OMAVIKUNJA_RELEASE_REMOTE (default origin),
