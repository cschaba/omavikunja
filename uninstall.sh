# Removes omavikunja from Omarchy.
#
# The same rule governs it as install.sh: it touches nothing outside omavikunja's
# own directories. It unregisters through omarchy's own commands, removes the
# symlink install.sh made, and — only when asked — omavikunja's own config and
# state. The keybinding lives in ~/.config/hypr/bindings.lua, which belongs to
# you: install.sh could not add it, so this cannot remove it either. It is
# printed for you to delete.

  Takes the widget off the bar, disables the plugin and removes the symlink
  in ~/.config/omarchy/plugins. --purge also removes omavikunja's own config
  and state under ~/.config/omavikunja and ~/.local/state/omavikunja.

  Your checkout is never deleted, and no file outside omavikunja's own
  directories is edited — the keybinding is printed for you to remove.

# the bar group has put, move and set and nothing that takes a widget away —
# so disable is the whole way back out.
